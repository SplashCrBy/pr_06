    "Watching movie is a major entertainment for modern people. Movies provide people with amusement and excitement widely. As the movie industry developing swiftly, our group wonder what elements may influence the box office of movies. To general understanding, the movies receives good reviews also have high revenues.\n",
    "To study this issue and further explore the relationship between the revenue and rating of movies, we go through the dataset of IMDB, which includes 1,000 most popular movies in the last 10 years, and the MovieLens dataset with 700 records. The data fields included are: Title, Genre, Description, Director, Actors, Year, Runtime, Rating, Votes, Revenue, meta score. We begin to have a general sense that revenue is proportional to ratings most times. However, there are other factors involved in the linear proportion between revenue and rating. For instance, some genres such as horror movies may be produced for minority. Those movies can receive good reviews but unable to be a huge hit. As we further analyze the dataset, we may find other factors that influence the reviews and box office of movies.\n",

Using dataset from single source of user group might be unappropriate to judge the reputation of the movies. To resolve the potential bias, we try to pull data from two major movie review websites, IMDB and MovieLens, in order to increase the diversity of user group. Although the user group of a major movie review website is large enough to reduce biases from individual differences, using data from two websites can still improve the diversity of the user group.\n"
